**About** (check this section before submisison and update as needed)

The *Stratobus Mission* game is targeted at learners aged 7-12 years. The aim is to navigate a high-altitude, long-endurance stratospheric airship (Thales’ *Stratobus*) through virtual cosmos while learning about and completing educational tasks linked to space, weather and near-Earth objects. The game incorporates real-time API data from sources such as NASA’s Open API Portal, providing players with realistic and engaging space-related tasks, as well as a database to store player progress, scores and questions. The front-end of the application will use PyGame to render different environments the player can interact with, as well as engaging interfaces for the various tasks and challenges in the game.
