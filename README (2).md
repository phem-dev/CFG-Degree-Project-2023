## Description

Stratobus Mission is a space-themed game targeted for learners aged 7-12 years. The aim of the game is to navigate a high-altitude, long-endurance stratospheric airship (Thales' *Stratobus*) through virtual cosmos to complete various missions while learning about and completing curriculum-based,educational tasks linked to space, weather, maths and near-Earth objects.  The game is built using the Pygame library, which provides the foundation for rendering graphics, handling events, and managing scenes. 

The game incorporates real-time API data from sources such as NASAâ€™s Open API Portal, providing players with realistic and engaging space-related tasks, as well as a database to store player progress, scores and questions. The front-end of the application will use PyGame to render different environments the player can interact with, as well as engaging interfaces for the various tasks and challenges in the game.
